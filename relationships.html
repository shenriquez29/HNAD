            <h2 class="rel">CONFLICT</h2>
            <p>
                This model portrays religion and science as competitive ideologies at odds. They are never to be intertwined or discussed as relating to one another. Religion, referring to the existence of God and his laws is spiritual and metaphysical, therefore, it cannot be related to science which focuses on the study of natural occurrences on Earth. Science has been discovered and constructed by humans, therefore it cannot relate to writing based on spirituality. Richard Dawkins, a well-known scientist supported the conflict theory in the way in which he advocated science and atheism against religious belief in his book, <em>The God Delusion</em> (2006). Christian organizations argue that by supporting evolution, humans denounce the creation of God leading to atheism, materialism and an erosion of morality (Shane, 168). These opposite opinions have led to many legal debates such as the Scopes Trial which found a substitute teacher guilty for teaching evolution which was banned in Tennessee in 1925. Teaching evolution in America continues to cause conflict. These opinions are ever changing but are guided by consistent dialogue.

            <h2 class="rel">INDEPENDENCE</h2>
            <p>
                Like conflict, science and religion should never be contemplated as being relevant to one another. They should remain separate as they provide different answers. Religion provides answers regarding human ethics, emotions and views of afterlife. Science provides answers for everyday natural occurrences such as gravity or medicine. Science and religion are separate ways of knowing, ways of life, cultures and languages (Barbour, 17).

            <h2 class="rel">INTEGRATION</h2>
            <p>
                This model proposes finding common ground between science and religion, looking to combine details of both ideologies. Naturalist, William Paley reconciled his religious beliefs as he acquired more scientific knowledge. For example, Paley in his book, <em>Natural Theology</em> (1802) encouraged appreciating the grandeur of nature as Godâ€™s work. Discovering more about the variations in species was not seen as strictly based on scientific laws, but as laws created by God (Browne,4). In order to contemplate integrating the two concepts, one must reject particular details on both sides. Charles Darwin was once a naturalist on the voyage of the Beagle as he appreciated the diversity of species and cultures in South America. He maintained his faith in God as he explored the jungles stating, "silence hosannah" (Pleins,27). Young Darwin found reconciliation between science and religion, but he became agnostic as his theory developed.

            <h2 class="rel">DIALOGUE</h2>
            <p>
                This model is unique in that it allows for the contemplation of the science and religion without fully combining or separating the two. Since science and religion do provide different answers for different questions, we can use those answers to examine various situations. For example, Pope Francis proposes this model in order to bring attention to the ecological crisis present in the world today. He states that science has provided concrete proof of the degradation of the environment, referring to the high levels of pollution, the water crisis and evidence of elevated carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere (73). Using this information along with the biblical scripture which states that humans must be environmental stewards and take care of the Earth, Francis proposes a thoughtful case on viewing the benefits of the relationship between science and religion.

            <h2 class="rel">RECONCILING SCIENCE AND RELIGION</h2>
            <p>
                Why must there a conflict between science and religion? Remaining in dialogue about aspects of both sides produce interesting discussions. Finding common ground on issues concerning the environment, animal rights and medicine between science and religion has provided many advancements. As Pope Francis stated: "Science and religion can enter into dialogue fruitful for both" (45). In the United States, controversy on the teaching of evolution continues to be present; however, more steps are being taken by science teachers and professors to incorporate ways of introducing both scientific theories such as evolution while also teaching students of the various religions in the world. This debate is not only an issue of the Western world but also existent in the middle east as teachers contemplate Islamic teachings and teaching students in higher education scientific theories such as evolution and the big bang theory in order to compete with non-religious universities in the world.
