                <h2 style="color:white;">CHRISTIANITY</h2>
                <p class= rtext style="color:black;">When Charles Darwin published his book <em>Origin of Species</em> and included <em>Descent of Man</em>, religious leaders expressed their criticism of Darwin's writing. Evolution, the advancement of species through natural selection stated that humans evolved from ape-like ancestors. By expanding on his observations and studies from the Voyage of the HMS Beagle, Darwin introduced an idea contrary to what was known of human origins as stated in the Bible. This sparked intellectual discussion prompting scientists and theologians to discuss how this theory could be accepted in an Anglican community. If we look at today's society, many different sects of Christianity exist as they identify their various interpretations of the Bible. Conservative churches refuse to accept the theory of evolution stating that it goes against Biblical scripture denouncing God and justifying immorality. Institutions such as the Discovery Institute (DI), Answers in Genesis (AiG), and the Institute for Creation Research (ICR) have vocalized their anti-evolution belief supporting creationism and proposing the teaching of intelligent design in schools (Shane, 172). However, other sects such as non-denominational churches have accepted aspects of theory while still remaining faithful. This correlates to a natural theology perspective in which God is the designer of natural laws. Religious leaders such as Pope Francis have encouraged metaphorical analysis of the creation story in order to accept the positive impacts of scientific research and encourage a dialogue between science and religion.

                <h2 style="color:white;">ISLAM</h2>
                <p class= rtext style="color:black;">The Qur'an teaches the creation story of Adam and Eve similar to Hebrew text. Therefore, traditional Islamic communities are committed to interpreting sacred text as historical and scientific. Modern communities have taken steps to encourage metaphorical interpretation and dialogue between science and religion. Opinions include appreciating scientific reasoning in order to enhance human knowledge. It is believed that if God(Allah) has revealed the methods in which he created the world, people should be at awe of this and further gain faith in his power. As stated in the Qur'an: "And the Earth We have spread it out, and set thereon mountains standing firm, and caused it to bring forth plants of beauteous kinds (in pairs). An insight and a reminder for every slave who turns to God. And We send down from the sky blessed water whereby We give growth unto gardens and the grain of crops. And tall palm-trees, with shoots of fruit-stalks, piled one over another" (Qur'an 50:6-10),(Mansour, 284). Although discussion of science is supported in order to gain knowledge, debate is also existent in Muslim school systems when referring to the theory of evolution. The main question is : How can Islam be “integrated” systematically into the day-to-day conduct of higher education? Universities of Islamic countries have struggled to create a science curriculum which attracts students to science majors and allows them to compete with student of non-religious universities yet still values and respects Islamic teachings (286). Many Islamic countries must contemplate the ways in which the natural sciences are taught since they must coincide with Islamic doctrine based on the Qur’an.

                <h2 style="color:white;">HINDUISM</h2>
                <p class= rtext style="color:white;">The Hindu perspective on science and specifically evolution is quite abstract. In Hinduism, there is no centralized institutionalized authority to decide what is acceptable in Hindu belief, resulting in a variety of opinions on the role of science in Hindu tradition. The Hindu creation story places emphasis on the grandeur of nature as a product of divine creation by multiple gods and goddesses in the sacred text, the Vedas. The text describes the forces which govern the world and sustain humanity, worshiping the sun, moon, water and wind. In the sacred text, the term avatara embodies the idea that organisms on Earth emerged gradually from simple to complex, implying the evolution of organisms including the evolution of humans from lifeless to mindful (Raman,551). However, not all Hindu worshipers interpret the Vedas this way. Many denounce evolution due to the fact that it eliminates the power of God in creating humans. Hinduism gives reverence to science in that in uncovers truth about the grandeur of the power of the gods. It has produced abstract interpretations, allowing for science to be discussed and contemplated. In Hindu societies, science is an important aspect of education as it allows for technological advancements. In India, science is highly valued as well as the traditions of Hindu spirituality continuing a dialog between both concepts. The discussion of science and religion is also cultural in that it brings together conservative and liberal mindsets within religions.

                <h2 style="color:white;">JUDAISM</h2>
                <p class= rtext style="color:black;">Judaism, similar to the viewpoints of Christianity and Islam, values the creation story but is tolerant of aspects of the natural sciences including evolution. Within each religion, exists different traditions. Therefore, Orthodox Jewish rabbis may view the theory of evolution and science as a whole differently from Non-Orthodox rabbis. God created the world with purpose, and established natural laws to govern the world including a moral-code. The Bible can be interpreted metaphorically in order to contemplate evolutionary theory. For example the creation of the universe occurred in a span of seven days; however, a day for God is not the same as a day for humans, leaving room to interpret the creation process as a longer span of time. Jewish religious leaders choose to reject aspects of evolutionary theory when it is used by scientists or atheists to refute belief in God and the uniqueness of humans. By believing that humans originated from a primitive common ancestor, people may conclude that people serve no purpose and therefore, do not have to abide by ethical laws. This implies the justification of discrimination of different races and disabled people as stated in Darwin’s <em>Descent of Man</em>. No religious institution can accept an aspect of a theory which implies that one human is superior over the other, since it would contradict all stated about loving thy neighbor and honoring God’s moral code (Steinberg). Darwin’s theory of evolution is only a theory, some aspects with strong evidence can be accepted, but the entire theory need not be fully designated as truth and a way of life.

                <h2 style="color:white;">BUDDHISM</h2>
                <p class= rtext style="color:white;">In Buddhism, the purpose of human life is to move from a state of suffering to a state of non-suffering. Therefore, from the Buddhist perspective, change and evolution over time is an inevitable part of life. When looking at Darwin’s theory of evolution from a Buddhist perspective, values such as impermanence and closeness to nature align with Buddha's teachings. Buddhism encourages obtaining knowledge to reach enlightenment through the Four Noble truths. It states that “within the realm of impermanent phenomena there is suffering, suffering has an origin, the elimination of suffering is possible and there is a path to end suffering” (Dalai Lama, 105). With this as a basis, Darwin’s theory can be seen as an explanation for the diversity and beauty in nature and has led to scientific discoveries about DNA and ways in which humans inherit genes. Although science provides remarkable explanations, it does not truly define life (sok, in the Buddhist text) for sentient beings (100). Buddhist theory answers ethical questions which cannot be learned through scientific theory. Like the monotheistic religions, Buddhism teaches followers how to develop a positive lifestyle.
