            <p>Charles Darwin formally introduced the concept of natural selection into the world after years of
                observing variations in animal species in his book, Origin of Species. Prior to this publication, many
                other naturalists had discussed the presence of gradual changes in species and the vast variations
                across animals, but Darwinâ€™s book was a catalyst for conversations on evolution thereafter. Darwin
                defined natural selection as a natural law in which an organism is able live and reproduce if it has
                acquired traits or adaptations enabling them to survive in their environment. This sparked controversy
                in Anglican England as church leaders criticized the theory for making the creationist story seems
                inaccurate. This ultimately changed perspectives on the way in which living organisms were created and
                the purpose of human life. Where did religious doctrine stand if the world was run by natural laws? Was
                the almighty creator the designer of these laws? Questions like these arose and continue to be discussed
                amongst scientists and theologians, creating interesting conversations on how religion and science can
                be viewed.
