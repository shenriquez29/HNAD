            <p>Charles Darwin introduced the term, natural selection in his book <em>Origin of Species</em> after years of observing variations in animal species. Prior to this publication, many other naturalists discussed the presence of gradual changes in species and the vast variations across animals, but Darwin's book was a catalyst for conversations on evolution thereafter. Darwin defined natural selection as a natural law in which an organism is able live and reproduce if it has acquired traits or adaptations enabling them to survive in their environment. The extension of his book, <em>Descent of Man</em> expanded on human origins, tracing their ancestors to apes. This sparked controversy in Anglican England as church leaders criticized the theory for making the creation story in the Bible seem inaccurate. This ultimately changed perspectives on the way in which living organisms were created and the purpose of human life. Where did religious doctrine stand if the world was run by natural laws? Was a  divine creator the designer of these laws? Questions like these arose and continue to be discussed amongst scientists and theologians, creating interesting conversations on how religion and science can be viewed.
